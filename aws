use lauch configuration/template, to update give new launch config/template,,free price for backend servers, iam on asg work for backen, if ec2 get temnited fr any reaon
ASG will recreate, replace instance marked unhealthy by LB. 
Scaling policies: 2 types 1>Dynamic 2>Predective: 1>Dynamic scaling: 1.1> Target tracking: if avg cpu > 40% increase 1.2>simple/step :can create own cloudwatch alarm and 
rules like if cpu >80 add 2 ec2 and cpu < 60 remove 2 instnaces can define cloud watch metrics 1.3>schedules:known usage 2>Provisioning:forecast & analysis by asg
ASG cooldown period:after scaling activity cooldown will come, no launch and terminate in this to stabilize metrics,,def 300sec, low cool hig perf, use golden ami for dis
ASG termination policy: default: find az with n number of instance, and inside it delete the oldest version means first created, balance instance in az,s along versions
ASG lifecycle hooks: p.wait,p.proceed,t.wait,t.proceed,, launch  config vs template: template is old not reusable need recreate, config: partial reusable, ondeamand or
spor or both, recomnded by aws,, both allows ami in confiuration

Elastic cache: redis&mem-cached, in memory db, highperf, lowlatency, reduce to db for common quaries, app ned heavy changes, aws can manage this fully for operations
redis: multi az/rr/persistance/backup&restore Memcached: multi node(sharding),multi threaded, nopersistant,restore & backup
Securiyt: IAM roles for only creae and delete cache not for the data inside cache, Redis auth: user/pwd while creating db will used inside app, ssl, memcached-sasl auth
types of caching: 1>lazy: some stale data,2> Write through: when db updates cache update no stale data3>session store: session data using ttl:: USE_CASE: leader boards

DNS: domain name system:convert host name into backend ip, terminology: domain registrer (ca), domain record:a,aaaa,cname,alias zonefile: dns record ,name server:quaries
(authorative/non autherative)-TLD-.com.in.us.gov,SLD-second amazon.com, 
flow--> web server --> local dns by org/cache iv ip to --> root dns give ip to--> TLD --> SLD --> here it will send the browser the actual ip of the service

Route 53: managed,scalable,authorative(user can maintain dns recordds), is domain register gie certs, health check of resources,100% availability sla,port 53 for dns
RECORD: contains domain or sub domain name/request type (A or AAAA or  CNAME or Alias)/value/Routing policy/TTL,, 
A: Maps a host name to ipv4,,AAAA: maps ahost name toipv6,,CNAME: maps a host name to another host name and dest ost name is eiter a or aaaa record,, and can't be a 
root domain ALIAS:is same as root domain only but can also use root,,,Alias: work for root and non root, health check,auto recginise backend ip changes, suported 
backends: elb, cloudfront,api,ebs,s3,vpe end points,oter r53 record in same hosted zone,global accelerator
NS(naming serer):for hosted zone contain dns name and ip can respond to quaies for trafic route
Hosted Zone: contain record that how to rout traffic,2 public (internet)and private(vpc), $0.50 per month
**Nslookup ordig cmds for lburl tosee the backend ips, TTL: time to leave, attach in client responce along public ip,2 high,low..High: less trafic for r53 but old data
Les: More traffic for r53 less ooutdated,must for all record type not ALIAS, dig command to see ttl
ROTING POLICY: simple,weighted,failover,latency based,geolocation,geo proximity,multi-value,, SIMPLE: tosingleresource, multiple values can,send to client, best chosen
by client, Weighted: control % trafic to speciic resource,backend dns have same name and type, health checks,use: LB b/w regiosn, test new ap fr less trafic, weight 
zero to stop sending, or 0 for all to sent trafic equally,,LATENCY: route to low latency instances, b/w user and aws region,health cheks,FAIL OVER: like dr, 1 primary 
1 secondary, primary not go for secondary,based on health check,,GEO LOCATION: Depends on location of user, if user in us go this ip,if in german go thi,default record
use: content loca,restrict in country,load balance,, health checks,,GEO PROXIMITY: baesd on geographic location, biasing,less-low, high-more,, traffic flow must(UI)
