ASG will recreate, replace instance marked unhealthy by LB. 
Scaling policies: 2 types 1>Dynamic 2>Predective: 1>Dynamic scaling: 1.1> Target tracking: if avg cpu > 40% increase 1.2>simple/step :can create own cloudwatch alarm and 
rules like if cpu >80 add 2 ec2 and cpu < 60 remove 2 instnaces can define cloud watch metrics 1.3>schedules:known usage 2>Provisioning:forecast & analysis by asg
ASG cooldown period:after scaling activity cooldown will come, no launch and terminate in this to stabilize metrics,,def 300sec, low cool hig perf, use golden ami for dis
ASG termination policy: default: find az with n number of instance, and inside it delete the oldest version means first created, balance instance in az,s along versions
ASG lifecycle hooks: p.wait,p.proceed,t.wait,t.proceed,, launch  config vs template: template is old not reusable need recreate, config: partial reusable, ondeamand or
spor or both, recomnded by aws,, both allows ami in confiuration
